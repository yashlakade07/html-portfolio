    <h1>The Best Movies According to Yash</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The social Network</h3>
    <p>
        I really like 'The Social Network' because it tells the exciting story of how Facebook started.
        The movie is fast and interesting, with great writing and directing. It shows the challenges and
        friendships involved in creating something big. Jesse Eisenberg's acting as Mark Zuckerberg is impressive.
        It's not just entertaining; it also teaches us about ambition, friendship, and how technology can change our lives.

    <h3>Steve jobs</h3>
    <p>
        'Steve Jobs' offers a riveting journey through the life of the Apple co-founder, 
        blending drama and inspiration to showcase his relentless pursuit of perfection and innovation.
